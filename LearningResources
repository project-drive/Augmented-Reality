 The new information is that we cannot use face recognition directly in Unity, 
 as ARCore doesn't support hence what we are going to do is install OpenCV,
 and then integrate it Unity. 
 Also the coding part now has the possibility of getting kinda messy as C++ comes in the picture now along with C#.
 You learn the integration part in the link below.
